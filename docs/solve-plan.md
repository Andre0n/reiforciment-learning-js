## Problem Understanding:
   - Grid Environment: The robot operates in a 6x14 grid.
   - Actions: The robot can move in 8 directions or stay put.
   - Dynamic Obstacle: Moves vertically (y-axis) with a random speed of 1, 2, or 3 steps. It wraps around when reaching the grid's boundaries.
   - Objective: Teach the robot to reach a target position in the grid without colliding with the obstacle.


## Reinforcement Learning Setup:

State Representation:
 - The state could be represented as a tuple (robot_position, obstacle_position), where both positions are coordinates in the grid.

Actions:
  - Possible actions include moving in one of the 8 directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonals) or staying in place.

Rewards:
 - Define rewards to encourage reaching the target position:
   - Positive reward when reaching the target.
   - Negative reward (penalty) for colliding with the obstacle or reaching grid boundaries.

Environment Dynamics:
 - Update the positions of both the robot and the obstacle based on their actions and the obstacle's random vertical movement.

Learning Algorithm:
  - Use Q-learning or Deep Q-learning (DQN) to train the robot:
  - Initialize Q-table or Q-network.
  - Explore-exploit strategy (e.g., Îµ-greedy) to balance exploration of new actions and exploitation of learned knowledge.
  - Update Q-values based on rewards received and future expected rewards.

Training Process:
  - Iterate through episodes where the robot tries to reach the target from random starting positions.
  - Update Q-values after each action using the Bellman equation:

Execution and Evaluation:
  - After training, evaluate the learned policy:
    - Simulate robot movements and observe if it reaches the target without colliding with the obstacle.
    - Adjust parameters and re-train if necessary to improve performance.

Implementation Considerations:
 - Handle grid boundaries and obstacle movements carefully to avoid out-of-bound errors.
 - Ensure the exploration rate decreases over time to favor exploitation of learned policies.
 - Monitor convergence of the Q-values and adjust learning parameters accordingly.
 - By following this approach, you can develop a reinforcement learning algorithm that enables 
    the robot to learn an effective policy for navigating the grid while avoiding collisions with 
    the dynamic obstacle.
